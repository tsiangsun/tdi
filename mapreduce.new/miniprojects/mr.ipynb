    "## Question 1: top100_words_simple_plain\n",
    "Return a list of the top 100 words in an article text (in no particular order). You will need to write this as two map reduces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first job is similar to standard wordcount but with a few tweaks. The data provided for wikipedia is in `*.xml.bz2` format.  Mrjob will automatically decompress `bz2`.  We'll deal with the `xml` in the next question. For now, just treat it as text.  A few hints:\n",
    "   - To split the words, use the regular expression \"\\w+\".\n",
    "   - Words are not case sensitive: i.e. \"The\" and \"the\" reference to the same word.  You can use `string.lower()` to get a single case-insenstive canonical version of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second job will take a collection of pairs `(word, count)` and filter for only the highest 100.  A few notes:\n",
    "    - **Passing parameters:** To make the job more reusable make the job find the largest `n` words where `n` is a parameter obtained via [`get_jobconf_value`](https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/utils-compat.html).\n",
    "    - **Keeping track of the top n:** We have to keep track of at most the `n` most popular words.  As long as `n` is small, e.g. 100, we can keep track of the *running largest n* in memory wtih a priority-queue. We suggest taking a look at `heapq` ([details](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html)), part of the Python standard library for this.  It allows you to push elemnets into a list while keeping track of the highest priority element.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "h = []\n",
    "heappush(h, (5, 'write code'))\n",
    "heappush(h, (7, 'release product'))\n",
    "heappush(h, (1, 'write spec'))\n",
    "heappush(h, (3, 'create tests'))\n",
    "heappop(h)  // returns (1, 'write spec')\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "       A naive implementation would cost $O(1)$ to insert but $O(n)$ to retrieve.  `heapq` uses a [self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree) to enable $O(\\log(n))$ insertion and $O(1)$ removal. You may be asked about this data structure on an interview so it is good to get practice with it now.\n",
    "    - **Working across nodes:** To obtain the largest `n`, we need to first obtain the largest n elements per chunk from the mapper, output them to the same key (reducer), and then collect the largest n elements of those in the reducer (**Question:** why does this gaurantee that we have found the largest n over the entire set?)\n",
    "    - **Working within a node:** Given that we are using a priority queue, we will need to first initialize it, then `push` or `pushpop` each record to it, and finally output the top `n` after seeing each record.  For mappers, notice that these three phases correspond nicely to these three functions:\n",
    "        - `mapper_init`\n",
    "        - `mapper`\n",
    "        - `mapper_final`\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are similar functions in the reducer.  Also, while the run method to launch the mapreduce job is a classmethod:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "          if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "            MRWordCount.run()\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "     actual instances of our mapreduce are instantiated on the map and reduce nodes.  More precisely, a separate mapper class is instantiated in each map node and a reducer class is instantiated in each reducer node.  This means that the three mapper functions can pass state through `self`, e.g. `self.heap`. Remember that to pass state between the map and reduce phase, you will have to use `yield` in the mapper and read each line in the reducer. (**Question:** Can you pass state between two mappers?)\n",
