    "\n",
    "   1. __`WHERE` (\"condition\"):__\n",

    "\n",
    "   1. __`ORDER BY` (sorting):__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   You can add a `SORT BY column_name1, column_name2, ...` to sort the results by the given column (applied in left-to-right order).  By default the sorting is ascending.  If you want it to be descending write e.g. `column_name1 DESC` (you can also write `ASC` for ascending to disambiguate).\n",

    "   1. __`LIMIT`:__\n",
    "   \n",
    "   If you want to just get at most the first N rows that would be returned, add on `LIMIT N`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. __`AS` (named expressions):__\n",
